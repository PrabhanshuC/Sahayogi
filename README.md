### Abstract
Software development involves a vast number of programming languages and frameworks, each supported by its own official documentation. This documentation is frequently dense and complex, posing a significant hurdle for both newcomers and experienced professionals. As a result, a substantial amount of time is spent researching and deciphering technical instructions rather than on active development.

To address this inefficiency, this project proposes the creation of a centralized web application to serve as a library of technical articles. The platform is designed to function as a universal learning resource, similar in concept to MDN Web Docs but covering a much wider range of technologies. Its purpose is to provide clear, standardized guides for implementing software features.

Each article will translate complex information from official sources into simplified, step-by-step instructions. An integral feature of the platform is the use of Artificial Intelligence to help automate the generation of content. This allows for the creation of a broad and scalable library of articles, ensuring comprehensive coverage of both foundational and advanced topics.

The primary objective is to produce an application that drastically reduces the time required to find and understand technical information. By offering a reliable source for clear implementation guides, the project aims to accelerate learning, streamline development cycles, and improve the overall productivity of its users.
